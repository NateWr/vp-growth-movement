# About this site

Growth of a Movement is a project of [Visualizing Palestine](https://visualizingpalestine.org). If you have questions about the content, spot a factual error that requires correction, or believe an event should be added to the timeline, please don’t hesitate to [reach out to us](https://visualizingpalestine.org/contact-us/).

## Purpose

This timeline was created to document some of the significant actions, events, and campaigns that have shaped the growth of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement around the world, and allow users to browse and explore this information.

## Scope

Events on this timeline vary from small symbolic steps to major campaign victories. This timeline does not claim to capture all instances or events of BDS organizing around the world, but provides a selection of significant moments that are illustrative of the impact of the movement.

## Limitations

The following are known limitations of our content:

- **Potential geographic skew:** The researchers working on this dataset are primarily English-speaking. Therefore, events covered in languages other than English may be underrepresented in our data. This is an important reason why we use BNC roundup lists as a starting point for determining which events to include on the timeline, as the BNC pays close attention to developments in non-English media.
- **Proving causality:** It is not always possible to prove that the BDS movement was the impetus for a particular event or action. Because of ongoing attempts to criminalize, repress, and stigmatize BDS in some countries, there is an incentive for actors to downplay or deny the role of BDS organizing on their actions. The BDS movement does not claim “credit” for events on this timeline, but it acknowledges that these events are consistent with its tactics and campaign goals, and that active BDS campaigns often exist in parallel.
