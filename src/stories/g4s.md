intro: |
  G4S, the largest security company in the world, was targeted by the BDS movement for providing services to Israeli prisons, police, the military, and illegal settlements.

  After a 13-year BDS campaign, G4S completely exited the Israeli market.

    summary: Palestinian organizations formally launch the Stop G4S campaign as Palestinian political prisoners begin a historic hunger strike. In 2005, G4S signed a contract with the Israeli Prison Service to provide services and supply and maintain equipment at Israeli prisons, where Palestinians are held without charge, tried in military courts, and tortured. G4S also provides services to the Israeli military and illegal Israeli settlements.

    summary: "Allied Universal, which acquired G4S in 2019, says it will sell its remaining stake in Policity, a move that would end G4Sâ€™ business in Israel."
conclusion: |
  After 13 years of tireless BDS campaigning, the largest security company in the world was forced to divest from apartheid Israel.

  This strategic and collective action cost the company millions in lost and cancelled contracts and forced them to acknowledge "reputational damage."
