    summary: "Allied Universal, which acquired G4S in 2019, says it will sell its remaining stake in Policity, a move that would end G4Sâ€™ business in Israel."
conclusion: |
  After 13 years of tireless BDS campaigning, the largest security company in the world was forced to divest from apartheid Israel.

  This strategic and collective action cost the company millions in lost and cancelled contracts and forced them to acknowledge "reputational damage."
